### Comparison Python Virtual Environment tools 
* 'venv' / 'virtualenv'
* 'Conda'
* 'pew'
* 'pipenv'

### Work context
* usage of python for e.g. leanix
* python virtual environments to test the code before and in the pipeline
### Problem
* current use: venv
* other tool might be faster? or have better capabilities 
* Pytest takes up to 3 min in venv --> performance boost?
* need: lightweight yet feature rich
